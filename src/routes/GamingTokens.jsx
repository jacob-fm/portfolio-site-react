        In the fall of my junior year of college, I took a course called Graphic
        Design Methodologies. One of the larger projects we were asked to
        produce was to produce a set of promotional materials for a hypothetical
        exhibition of something from&nbsp;
        <a href="https://www.yale.edu/collections" target="_blank">
          the Yale Collections.&nbsp;
        </a>
        After some digging, I came across a collection of Chinese
        mother-of-pearl gaming counters from the 18th and 19th centuries. If
        youâ€™re interested in learning about the history of these pieces, I
        highly recommend reading more about it&nbsp;

        At first, I was unsure how I would entice people to come view the
        exhibition. There were many potential angles of attack. I thought, for
        instance, that I might try to create materials that emphasized the
        multi-cultural history of these artifacts, which originated in China but
        mainly used in the West. But considering the wide array of materials I
        was to produce, and thinking about the hypothetical audience of these
        materials (busy college students barely glancing at bulletin boards), I
        decided on a more sensational approach. When I had initially visited
        the&nbsp;
        <a href="https://beinecke.library.yale.edu/" target="_blank">
          Beinecke Library&nbsp;
        </a>
        to view the collection and take photos, I was interested in the unique
        shapes of many of the tokens, and in the iridescence of the
        mother-of-pearl surface. I decided to see what I could do to emphasize
        these qualities. Iridescence is a hard thing to capture in a static
        photo, since its effect is only noticed when a surface is viewed from a
        variety of angles.

        We were asked to produce a series of flyers, postcards, promotional
        instagram posts, and finally a mockup of an installation to be shown
        along with the artifacts.

      <h2>Installation Mockup</h2>
      <p>
        I created a video showing what it might look like to have a blown-up
        image of one of the tokens, with a lenticular effect, such that at
        certain angles, an image of the family who owned this token would
        appear.

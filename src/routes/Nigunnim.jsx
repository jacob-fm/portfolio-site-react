        "Nigunnim" was an artwork I created for the Blanksteen Fellowship, at
        the Joseph Slifka Center for Jewish Life at Yale in 2023. I, along with
        the rest of the cohort, were given the phrase "How does speech become
        violence?" as a prompt for our work. I was inspired to use a mixture of
        audio and video synthesis tools to explore wordless tunes, similar to
        the "nigunnim" I grew up with.

        From my artist statement:

          When approaching the themes of speech and violence, I dug in to find
          something that spoke to me in relation to what l've made in the past.
          I thought about violence due to lack of speech, and the frustration
          and anger that can arise when words fail. I thought back to my days in
          summer camp; in particular, I remembered debates with a friend on
          whether the nigunnim (tunes) we sang on Shabbat were better with or
          without lyrics.

          My friend argued that when we sang the tunes without words, we were
          tapping into something deeper and truer than what our words could say.
          At the time I thought it was nonsensical and silly. Looking back, I'm
          not so sure. This piece was an opportunity to take what l've learned
          about music production to explore and compose nigunnim that make use
          of modern electronic instrumentation while incorporating the
          meditative, trance-like qualities of a wordless nigun. I used the
          accompanying visuals to transform a purely auditory experience into an
          even more immersive atmosphere.
